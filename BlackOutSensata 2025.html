Dear valued customers,

Sensata Technologies recently identified and is addressing a ransomware incident that has encrypted certain devices in our network and has temporarily disrupted our production capabilities.

Upon identifying the incident, we immediately implemented our response protocols, activated containment measures, including proactively taking our network offline, and launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party professionals. We also notified law enforcement and are supporting its investigation. We have dedicated teams working to quickly and securely restore normal business operations. While we continue to work through this incident, we ask you to keep this information confidential within your organization to assist us in resolving this issue.

At this stage, your support is critical. Please keep this information confidential within your organization and ensure that your organization shares with Sensata your bare product demands for the upcoming days per site and per product. We currently have limited ability to produce certain products in certain manufacturing locations and will work to deliver orders where and when able. In addition, we would kindly request that a clear communication channel is set for Sensata to have visibility to your call-offs/demand outlook.

Your Sensata customer service point of contact will be supporting to ensure best alignment between demand & supply.

Be assured we are doing our utmost to quickly and safely resolve this matter.

Best regards,
Dan Goncalves
Vice President and General Manager - Sensata Technologies`
